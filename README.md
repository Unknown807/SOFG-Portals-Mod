# Shadows Of The Forbidden Gods Portals Mod

This is my first mod for this game and is quite simple given that modding for the game is currently limited to story driven events.

This mod adds a range of new minions your agents can summon and a few heros on the world map that you can also control, by completing certain conditions. These minions and heros appear in certain events while you walk around the map and interact.

The general theme is that portals to other realms open up spontaneously and spawn heros and minions for you to use, but at the same time there will be 'hunters' who spawn as well. These hunters dislike you and will try their best to aid humanity's side.
